<h2>REGINALD</h2>
<p>I did it&mdash;I who should have known better.&nbsp; I 
persuaded Reginald to go to the McKillops&rsquo; garden-party 
against his will.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes occasionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know you&rsquo;re here, and they&rsquo;ll think it
so funny if you don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; And I want particularly to 
be in with Mrs. McKillop just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, you want one of her smoke Persian kittens as a 
prospective wife for Wumples&mdash;or a husband, is 
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Reginald has a magnificent scorn for details, 
other than sartorial.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And I am expected to undergo 
social martyrdom to suit the connubial 
exigencies&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reginald!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing of the kind, only 
I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. McKillop Would be pleased if I brought 
you.&nbsp; Young men of your brilliant attractions are rather at 
a premium at her garden-parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be at a premium in heaven,&rdquo; remarked 
Reginald complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be very few of you there, if that is what 
you mean.&nbsp; But seriously, there won&rsquo;t be any great 
strain upon your powers of endurance; I promise you that you 
shan&rsquo;t have to play croquet, or talk to the 
Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife, or do anything that is likely to bring 
on physical prostration.&nbsp; You can just wear your sweetest 
clothes and moderately amiable expression, and eat 
chocolate-creams with the appetite of a <i>blas&eacute;</i> 
parrot.&nbsp; Nothing more is demanded of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald shut his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be the 
exhaustingly up-to-date young women who will ask me if I have 
seen <i>San Toy</i>; a less progressive grade who will yearn to 
hear about the Diamond Jubilee&mdash;the historic event, not the 
horse.&nbsp; With a little encouragement, they will inquire if I 
saw the Allies march into Paris.&nbsp; Why are women so fond of 
raking up the past?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re as bad as tailors, who 
invariably remember what you owe them for a suit long after 
you&rsquo;ve ceased to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order lunch for one o&rsquo;clock; that will
give you two and a half hours to dress in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald puckered his brow into a tortured frown, and I knew 
that my point was gained.&nbsp; He was debating what tie would go
with which waistcoat.</p>
<p>Even then I had my misgivings.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>During the drive to the McKillops&rsquo; Reginald was 
possessed with a great peace, which was not wholly to be 
accounted for by the fact that he had inveigled his feet into 
shoes a size too small for them.&nbsp; I misgave more than ever, 
and having once launched Reginald on to the McKillops&rsquo; 
lawn, I established him near a seductive dish of <i>marrons 
glac&eacute;s</i>, and as far from the Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife as
possible; as I drifted away to a diplomatic distance I heard with
painful distinctness the eldest Mawkby girl asking him if he had 
seen <i>San Toy</i>.</p>
<p>It must have been ten minutes later, not more, and I had been 
having <i>quite</i> an enjoyable chat with my hostess, and had 
promised to lend her <i>The Eternal City</i> and my recipe for 
rabbit mayonnaise, and was just about to offer a kind home for 
her third Persian kitten, when I perceived, out of the corner of 
my eye, that Reginald was not where I had left him, and that the 
<i>marrons glac&eacute;s</i> were untasted.&nbsp; At the same 
moment I became aware that old Colonel Mendoza was essaying to 
tell his classic story of how he introduced golf into India, and 
that Reginald was in dangerous proximity.&nbsp; There are 
occasions when Reginald is caviare to the Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was at Poona in &rsquo;76&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Colonel,&rdquo; purred Reginald, &ldquo;fancy 
admitting such a thing!&nbsp; Such a give-away for one&rsquo;s 
age!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t admit being on this planet in 
&rsquo;76.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Reginald in his wildest lapses into 
veracity never admits to being more than twenty-two.)</p>
<p>The Colonel went to the colour of a fig that has attained 
great ripeness, and Reginald, ignoring my efforts to intercept 
him, glided away to another part of the lawn.&nbsp; I found him a
few minutes later happily engaged in teaching the youngest 
Rampage boy the approved theory of mixing absinthe, within full 
earshot of his mother.&nbsp; Mrs. Rampage occupies a prominent 
place in local Temperance movements.</p>
<p>As soon as I had broken up this unpromising 
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> and settled Reginald where 
he could watch the croquet players losing their tempers, I 
wandered off to find my hostess and renew the kitten negotiations
at the point where they had been interrupted.&nbsp; I did not 
succeed in running her down at once, and eventually it was Mrs. 
McKillop who sought me out, and her conversation was not of 
kittens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cousin is discussing <i>Zaza</i> with the 
Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife; at least, he is discussing, she is 
ordering her carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in the dry, staccato tone of one who repeats a 
French exercise, and I knew that as far as Millie McKillop was 
concerned, Wumples was devoted to a lifelong celibacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; I said hurriedly, 
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d like our carriage ordered too,&rdquo; 
and I made a forced march in the direction of the 
croquet-ground.</p>
<p>I found everyone talking nervously and feverishly of the 
weather and the war in South Africa, except Reginald, who was 
reclining in a comfortable chair with the dreamy, far-away look 
that a volcano might wear just after it had desolated entire 
villages.&nbsp; The Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife was buttoning up her 
gloves with a concentrated deliberation that was fearful to 
behold.&nbsp; I shall have to treble my subscription to her 
Cheerful Sunday Evenings Fund before I dare set foot in her house
again.</p>
<p>At that particular moment the croquet players finished their 
game, which had been going on without a symptom of finality 
during the whole afternoon.&nbsp; Why, I ask, should it have 
stopped precisely when a counter-attraction was so 
necessary?&nbsp; Everyone seemed to drift towards the area of 
disturbance, of which the chairs of the Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife 
and Reginald formed the storm-centre.&nbsp; Conversation flagged,
and there settled upon the company that expectant hush that 
precedes the dawn&mdash;when your neighbours don&rsquo;t happen 
to keep poultry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the Caspian Sea?&rdquo; asked Reginald, with 
appalling suddenness.</p>
<p>There were symptoms of a stampede.&nbsp; The 
Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife looked at me.&nbsp; Kipling or someone 
has described somewhere the look a foundered camel gives when the
caravan moves on and leaves it to its fate.&nbsp; The peptonised 
reproach in the good lady&rsquo;s eyes brought the passage 
vividly to my mind.</p>
<p>I played my last card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reginald, it&rsquo;s getting late, and a sea-mist is 
coming on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew that the elaborate curl over his 
right eyebrow was not guaranteed to survive a sea-mist.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never again, will I take you to a 
garden-party.&nbsp; Never . . . You behaved abominably . . . What
did the Caspian see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade of genuine regret for misused opportunities passed 
over Reginald&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe an apricot 
tie would have gone better with the lilac waistcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON CHRISTMAS PRESENTS</h2>
<p>I wish it to be distinctly understood (said Reginald) that I 
don&rsquo;t want a &ldquo;George, Prince of Wales&rdquo; 
Prayer-book as a Christmas present.&nbsp; The fact cannot be too 
widely known.</p>
<p>There ought (he continued) to be technical education classes 
on the science of present-giving.&nbsp; No one seems to have the 
faintest notion of what anyone else wants, and the prevalent 
ideas on the subject are not creditable to a civilised 
community.</p>
<p>There is, for instance, the female relative in the country who
&ldquo;knows a tie is always useful,&rdquo; and sends you some 
spotted horror that you could only wear in secret or in Tottenham
Court Road.&nbsp; It <i>might</i> have been useful had she kept 
it to tie up currant bushes with, when it would have served the 
double purpose of supporting the branches and frightening away 
the birds&mdash;for it is an admitted fact that the ordinary 
tomtit of commerce has a sounder &aelig;sthetic taste than the 
average female relative in the country.</p>
<p>Then there are aunts.&nbsp; They are always a difficult class 
to deal with in the matter of presents.&nbsp; The trouble is that
one never catches them really young enough.&nbsp; By the time one
has educated them to an appreciation of the fact that one does 
not wear red woollen mittens in the West End, they die, or 
quarrel with the family, or do something equally 
inconsiderate.&nbsp; That is why the supply of trained aunts is 
always so precarious.</p>
<p>There is my Aunt Agatha, <i>par exemple</i>, who sent me a 
pair of gloves last Christmas, and even got so far as to choose a
kind that was being worn and had the correct number of 
buttons.&nbsp; But&mdash;<i>they were nines</i>!&nbsp; I sent 
them to a boy whom I hated intimately: he didn&rsquo;t wear them,
of course, but he could have&mdash;that was where the bitterness 
of death came in.&nbsp; It was nearly as consoling as sending 
white flowers to his funeral.&nbsp; Of course I wrote and told my
aunt that they were the one thing that had been wanting to make 
existence blossom like a rose; I am afraid she thought me 
frivolous&mdash;she comes from the North, where they live in the 
fear of Heaven and the Earl of Durham.&nbsp; (Reginald affects an
exhaustive knowledge of things political, which furnishes an 
excellent excuse for not discussing them.)&nbsp; Aunts with a 
dash of foreign extraction in them are the most satisfactory in 
the way of understanding these things; but if you can&rsquo;t 
choose your aunt, it is wisest in the long-run to choose the 
present and send her the bill.</p>
<p>Even friends of one&rsquo;s own set, who might be expected to 
know better, have curious delusions on the subject.&nbsp; I am 
<i>not</i> collecting copies of the cheaper editions of Omar 
Khayyam.&nbsp; I gave the last four that I received to the 
lift-boy, and I like to think of him reading them, with 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s notes, to his aged mother.&nbsp; Lift-boys 
always have aged mothers; shows such nice feeling on their part, 
I think.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&rsquo;t see where the difficulty in choosing
suitable presents lies.&nbsp; No boy who had brought himself up 
properly could fail to appreciate one of those decorative bottles
of liqueurs that are so reverently staged in Morel&rsquo;s 
window&mdash;and it wouldn&rsquo;t in the least matter if one did
get duplicates.&nbsp; And there would always be the supreme 
moment of dreadful uncertainty whether it was <i>cr&ecirc;me de 
menthe</i> or Chartreuse&mdash;like the expectant thrill on 
seeing your partner&rsquo;s hand turned up at bridge.&nbsp; 
People may say what they like about the decay of Christianity; 
the religious system that produced green Chartreuse can never 
really die.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are liqueur glasses, and 
crystallised fruits, and tapestry curtains, and heaps of other 
necessaries of life that make really sensible presents&mdash;not 
to speak of luxuries, such as having one&rsquo;s bills paid, or 
getting something quite sweet in the way of jewellery.&nbsp; 
Unlike the alleged Good Woman of the Bible, I&rsquo;m not above 
rubies.&nbsp; When found, by the way, she must have been rather a
problem at Christmas-time; nothing short of a blank cheque would 
have fitted the situation.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s as well that 
she&rsquo;s died out.</p>
<p>The great charm about me (concluded Reginald) is that I am so 
easily pleased.&nbsp; But I draw the line at a &ldquo;Prince of 
Wales&rdquo; Prayer-book.</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON THE ACADEMY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;One goes to the Academy in self-defence,&rdquo; said 
Reginald.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the one topic one has in common with
the Country Cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is almost a religious observance with them,&rdquo; 
said the Other.&nbsp; &ldquo;A kind of artistic Mecca, and when 
the good ones die they go&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Chantrey Bequest.&nbsp; The mystery is 
<i>what</i> they find to talk about in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two subjects of conversation in the country: 
Servants, and Can fowls be made to pay?&nbsp; The first, I 
believe, is compulsory, the second optional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a function,&rdquo; resumed Reginald, &ldquo;the 
Academy is a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it would be tolerable without the 
pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pictures are all right, in their way; after all, 
one can always <i>look</i> at them if one is bored with 
one&rsquo;s surroundings, or wants to avoid an imminent 
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that doesn&rsquo;t always save one.&nbsp; There is
the inevitable female whom you met once in Devonshire, or the 
Matoppo Hills, or somewhere, who charges up to you with the 
remark that it&rsquo;s funny how one always meets people one 
knows at the Academy.&nbsp; Personally, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> 
think it funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suffered in that way just now,&rdquo; said Reginald 
plaintively, &ldquo;from a woman whose word I had to take that 
she had met me last summer in Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you were not too brutal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely told her with engaging simplicity that the art
of life was the avoidance of the unattainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she try and work it out on the back of her 
catalogue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there and then.&nbsp; She murmured something about 
being &lsquo;so clever.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fancy coming to the Academy 
to be clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be clever in the afternoon argues that one is dining
nowhere in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me that I can&rsquo;t remember whether I 
accepted an invitation from you to dine at Kettner&rsquo;s 
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, I can remember with startling 
distinctness not having asked you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much certainty is unbecoming in the young; so 
we&rsquo;ll consider that settled.&nbsp; What were you talking 
about?&nbsp; Oh, pictures.&nbsp; Personally, I rather like them; 
they are so refreshingly real and probable, they take one away 
from the unrealities of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One likes to escape from oneself 
occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the disadvantage of a portrait; as a rule, 
one&rsquo;s bitterest friends can find nothing more to ask than 
the faithful unlikeness that goes down to posterity as 
oneself.&nbsp; I hate posterity&mdash;it&rsquo;s so fond of 
having the last word.&nbsp; Of course, as regards portraits, 
there are exceptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To die before being painted by Sargent is to go to 
heaven prematurely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the necessary care and impatience, you may avoid 
that catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be rude,&rdquo; said Reginald,
&ldquo;I shall dine with you to-morrow night as well.&nbsp; The 
chief vice of the Academy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is its 
nomenclature.&nbsp; Why, for instance, should an obvious 
trout-stream with a palpable rabbit sitting in the foreground be 
called &lsquo;an evening dream of unbeclouded peace,&rsquo; or 
something of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think,&rdquo; said the Other, &ldquo;that a name 
should economise description rather than stimulate 
imagination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Properly chosen, it should do both.&nbsp; There is my 
lady kitten at home, for instance; I&rsquo;ve called it 
Derry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suggests nothing to my imagination but protracted 
sieges and religious animosities.&nbsp; Of course, I don&rsquo;t 
know your kitten&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re silly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sweet name, 
and it answers to it&mdash;when it wants to.&nbsp; Then, if there
are any unseemly noises in the night, they can be explained 
succinctly: Derry and Toms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might almost charge for the advertisement.&nbsp; 
But as applied to pictures, don&rsquo;t you think your system 
would be too subtle, say, for the Country Cousins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every reformation must have its victims.&nbsp; You 
can&rsquo;t expect the fatted calf to share the enthusiasm of the
angels over the prodigal&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; Another darling 
weakness of the Academy is that none of its luminaries must 
&lsquo;arrive&rsquo; in a hurry.&nbsp; You can see them coming 
for years, like a Balkan trouble or a street improvement, and by 
the time they have painted a thousand or so square yards of 
canvas, their work begins to be recognised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone who Must Not be Contradicted said that a man 
must be a success by the time he&rsquo;s thirty, or 
never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have reached thirty,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;is
to have failed in life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD AT THE THEATRE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said the Duchess vaguely, 
&ldquo;there are certain things you can&rsquo;t get away 
from.&nbsp; Right and wrong, good conduct and moral rectitude, 
have certain well-defined limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, for the matter of that,&rdquo; replied Reginald, 
&ldquo;has the Russian Empire.&nbsp; The trouble is that the 
limits are not always in the same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald and the Duchess regarded each other with mutual 
distrust, tempered by a scientific interest.&nbsp; Reginald 
considered that the Duchess had much to learn; in particular, not
to hurry out of the Carlton as though afraid of losing 
one&rsquo;s last &rsquo;bus.&nbsp; A woman, he said, who is 
careless of disappearances is capable of leaving town before 
Goodwood, and dying at the wrong moment of an unfashionable 
disease.</p>
<p>The Duchess thought that Reginald did not exceed the ethical 
standard which circumstances demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she resumed combatively, 
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the prevailing fashion to believe in perpetual 
change and mutability, and all that sort of thing, and to say we 
are all merely an improved form of primeval ape&mdash;of course 
you subscribe to that doctrine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it decidedly premature; in most people I know 
the process is far from complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And equally of course you are quite 
irreligious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by no means.&nbsp; The fashion just now is a Roman 
Catholic frame of mind with an Agnostic conscience: you get the 
medi&aelig;val picturesqueness of the one with the modern 
conveniences of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duchess suppressed a sniff.&nbsp; She was one of those 
people who regard the Church of England with patronising 
affection, as if it were something that had grown up in their 
kitchen garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are other things,&rdquo; she continued, 
&ldquo;which I suppose are to a certain extent sacred even to 
you.&nbsp; Patriotism, for instance, and Empire, and Imperial 
responsibility, and blood-is-thicker-than-water, and all that 
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald waited for a couple of minutes before replying, while
the Lord of Rimini temporarily monopolised the acoustic 
possibilities of the theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the worst of a tragedy,&rdquo; he observed, 
&ldquo;one can&rsquo;t always hear oneself talk.&nbsp; Of course 
I accept the Imperial idea and the responsibility.&nbsp; After 
all, I would just as soon think in Continents as anywhere 
else.&nbsp; And some day, when the season is over and we have the
time, you shall explain to me the exact blood-brotherhood and all
that sort of thing that exists between a French Canadian and a 
mild Hindoo and a Yorkshireman, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, &lsquo;dominion over palm and pine,&rsquo; 
you know,&rdquo; quoted the Duchess hopefully; &ldquo;of course 
we mustn&rsquo;t forget that we&rsquo;re all part of the great 
Anglo-Saxon Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which for its part is rapidly becoming a suburb of 
Jerusalem.&nbsp; A very pleasant suburb, I admit, and quite a 
charming Jerusalem.&nbsp; But still a suburb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, to be told one&rsquo;s living in a suburb when 
one is conscious of spreading the benefits of civilisation all 
over the world!&nbsp; Philanthropy&mdash;I suppose you will say 
<i>that</i> is a comfortable delusion; and yet even you must 
admit that whenever want or misery or starvation is known to 
exist, however distant or difficult of access, we instantly 
organise relief on the most generous scale, and distribute it, if
need be, to the uttermost ends of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duchess paused, with a sense of ultimate triumph.&nbsp; 
She had made the same observation at a drawing-room meeting, and 
it had been extremely well received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;if you have ever
walked down the Embankment on a winter night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, no, child!&nbsp; Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t; I only wondered.&nbsp; And even your 
philanthropy, practised in a world where everything is based on 
competition, must have a debit as well as a credit account.&nbsp;
The young ravens cry for food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are fed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; Which presupposes that something else is
fed upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re simply exasperating.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ve been reading Nietzsche till you haven&rsquo;t got 
any sense of moral proportion left.&nbsp; May I ask if you are 
governed by <i>any</i> laws of conduct whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain fixed rules that one observes for 
one&rsquo;s own comfort.&nbsp; For instance, never be flippantly 
rude to any inoffensive grey-bearded stranger that you may meet 
in pine forests or hotel smoking-rooms on the Continent.&nbsp; It
always turns out to be the King of Sweden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The restraint must be dreadfully irksome to you.&nbsp; 
When I was younger, boys of your age used to be nice and 
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are only nice.&nbsp; One must specialise in 
these days.&nbsp; Which reminds me of the man I read of in some 
sacred book who was given a choice of what he most desired.&nbsp;
And because he didn&rsquo;t ask for titles and honours and 
dignities, but only for immense wealth, these other things came 
to him also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you didn&rsquo;t read about him in any sacred
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I fancy you will find him in Debrett.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD&rsquo;S PEACE POEM</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing a poem on Peace,&rdquo; said 
Reginald, emerging from a sweeping operation through a tin of 
mixed biscuits, in whose depths a macaroon or two might yet be 
lurking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the kind seems to have been attempted 
already,&rdquo; said the Other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know; but I may never have the chance 
again.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;ve got a new fountain pen.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t pretend to have gone on any very original lines; in 
writing about Peace the thing is to say what everybody else is 
saying, only to say it better.&nbsp; It begins with the usual 
ornithological emotion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When the widgeon westward winging<br />
Heard the folk Vereeniginging,<br />
Heard the shouting and the singing&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Vereeniginging is good, but why widgeon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Anything that winged westward would 
naturally begin with a <i>w</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need it wing westward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird must go somewhere.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t 
have it hang around and look foolish.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ve 
brought in something about the heedless hartebeest galloping over
the deserted veldt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know it&rsquo;s practically extinct in 
those regions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help <i>that</i>, it gallops so 
nicely.&nbsp; I make it have all sorts of unexpected 
yearnings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mother, may I go and maffick,<br />
Tear around and hinder traffic?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;ll say there would be no traffic worth 
bothering about on the bare and sun-scorched veldt, but 
there&rsquo;s no other word that rhymes with maffick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seraphic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might do, but I&rsquo;ve 
got a lot about angels later on.&nbsp; You must have angels in a 
Peace poem; I know dreadfully little about their 
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can do unexpected things, like the 
hartebeest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; Then I turn on London, the City of 
Dreadful Nocturnes, resonant with hymns of joy and 
thanksgiving&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And the sleeper, eye unlidding,<br />
Heard a voice for ever bidding<br />
Much farewell to Dolly Gray;<br />
Turning weary on his truckle-<br />
Bed he heard the honey-suckle<br />
Lauded in apiarian lay.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longfellow at his best wrote nothing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a sweet 
temper, but I can&rsquo;t stand being agreed with.&nbsp; And 
I&rsquo;m so worried about the aasvogel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald stared dismally at the biscuit-tin, which now 
presented an unattractive array of rejected cracknels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;if I could find a
woman with an unsatisfied craving for cracknels, I should marry 
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the tragedy of the aasvogel?&rdquo; asked the 
Other sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, simply that there&rsquo;s no rhyme for it.&nbsp; I 
thought about it all the time I was dressing&mdash;it&rsquo;s 
dreadfully bad for one to think whilst one&rsquo;s 
dressing&mdash;and all lunch-time, and I&rsquo;m still hung up 
over it.&nbsp; I feel like those unfortunate automobilists who 
achieve an unenviable motoriety by coming to a hopeless stop with
their cars in the most crowded thoroughfares.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
afraid I shall have to drop the aasvogel, and it did give such 
lovely local colour to the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still you&rsquo;ve got the heedless 
hartebeest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite a decorative bit of moral 
admonition&mdash;when you&rsquo;ve worried the meaning 
out&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Cease, War, thy bubbling madness that the 
wine shares,<br />
And bid thy legions turn their swords to mine shares.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mine shares seems to fit the case better than 
ploughshares.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots more about the blessings 
of Peace, shall I go on reading it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I must make a choice, I think I would rather they 
went on with the war.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD&rsquo;S CHOIR TREAT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; wrote Reginald to his most darling 
friend, &ldquo;be a pioneer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Early Christian
that gets the fattest lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald, in his way, was a pioneer.</p>
<p>None of the rest of his family had anything approaching Titian
hair or a sense of humour, and they used primroses as a table 
decoration.</p>
<p>It follows that they never understood Reginald, who came down 
late to breakfast, and nibbled toast, and said disrespectful 
things about the universe.&nbsp; The family ate porridge, and 
believed in everything, even the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Therefore the family was relieved when the vicar&rsquo;s 
daughter undertook the reformation of Reginald.&nbsp; Her name 
was Amabel; it was the vicar&rsquo;s one extravagance.&nbsp; 
Amabel was accounted a beauty and intellectually gifted; she 
never played tennis, and was reputed to have read 
Maeterlinck&rsquo;s <i>Life of the Bee</i>.&nbsp; If you abstain 
from tennis <i>and</i> read Maeterlinck in a small country 
village, you are of necessity intellectual.&nbsp; Also she had 
been twice to F&eacute;camp to pick up a good French accent from 
the Americans staying there; consequently she had a knowledge of 
the world which might be considered useful in dealings with a 
worldling.</p>
<p>Hence the congratulations in the family when Amabel undertook 
the reformation of its wayward member.</p>
<p>Amabel commenced operations by asking her unsuspecting pupil 
to tea in the vicarage garden; she believed in the healthy 
influence of natural surroundings, never having been in Sicily, 
where things are different.</p>
<p>And like every woman who has ever preached repentance to 
unregenerate youth, she dwelt on the sin of an empty life, which 
always seems so much more scandalous in the country, where people
rise early to see if a new strawberry has happened during the 
night.</p>
<p>Reginald recalled the lilies of the field, &ldquo;which simply
sat and looked beautiful, and defied competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not an example for us to follow,&rdquo; 
gasped Amabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t afford to.&nbsp; You 
don&rsquo;t know what a world of trouble I take in trying to 
rival the lilies in their artistic simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are really indecently vain of your 
appearance.&nbsp; A good life is infinitely preferable to good 
looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You agree with me that the two are incompatible.&nbsp; 
I always say beauty is only sin deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amabel began to realise that the battle is not always to the 
strong-minded.&nbsp; With the immemorial resource of her sex, she
abandoned the frontal attack, and laid stress on her unassisted 
labours in parish work, her mental loneliness, her 
discouragements&mdash;and at the right moment she produced 
strawberries and cream.&nbsp; Reginald was obviously affected by 
the latter, and when his preceptress suggested that he might 
begin the strenuous life by helping her to supervise the annual 
outing of the bucolic infants who composed the local choir, his 
eyes shone with the dangerous enthusiasm of a convert.</p>
<p>Reginald entered on the strenuous life alone, as far as Amabel
was concerned.&nbsp; The most virtuous women are not proof 
against damp grass, and Amabel kept her bed with a cold.&nbsp; 
Reginald called it a dispensation; it had been the dream of his 
life to stage-manage a choir outing.&nbsp; With strategic 
insight, he led his shy, bullet-headed charges to the nearest 
woodland stream and allowed them to bathe; then he seated himself
on their discarded garments and discoursed on their immediate 
future, which, he decreed, was to embrace a Bacchanalian 
procession through the village.&nbsp; Forethought had provided 
the occasion with a supply of tin whistles, but the introduction 
of a he-goat from a neighbouring orchard was a brilliant 
afterthought.&nbsp; Properly, Reginald explained, there should 
have been an outfit of panther skins; as it was, those who had 
spotted handkerchiefs were allowed to wear them, which they did 
with thankfulness.&nbsp; Reginald recognised the impossibility, 
in the time at his disposal, of teaching his shivering neophytes 
a chant in honour of Bacchus, so he started them off with a more 
familiar, if less appropriate, temperance hymn.&nbsp; After all, 
he said, it is the spirit of the thing that counts.&nbsp; 
Following the etiquette of dramatic authors on first nights, he 
remained discreetly in the background while the procession, with 
extreme diffidence and the goat, wound its way lugubriously 
towards the village.&nbsp; The singing had died down long before 
the main street was reached, but the miserable wailing of pipes 
brought the inhabitants to their doors.&nbsp; Reginald said he 
had seen something like it in pictures; the villagers had seen 
nothing like it in their lives, and remarked as much freely.</p>
<p>Reginald&rsquo;s family never forgave him.&nbsp; They had no 
sense of humour.</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON WORRIES</h2>
<p>I have (said Reginald) an aunt who worries.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s 
not really an aunt&mdash;a sort of amateur one, and they 
aren&rsquo;t really worries.&nbsp; She is a social success, and 
has no domestic tragedies worth speaking of, so she adopts any 
decorative sorrows that are going, myself included.&nbsp; In that
way she&rsquo;s the antithesis, or whatever you call it, to those
sweet, uncomplaining women one knows who have seen trouble, and 
worn blinkers ever since.&nbsp; Of course, one just loves them 
for it, but I must confess they make me uncomfy; they remind one 
so of a duck that goes flapping about with forced cheerfulness 
long after its head&rsquo;s been cut off.&nbsp; Ducks have 
<i>no</i> repose.&nbsp; Now, my aunt has a shade of hair that 
suits her, and a cook who quarrels with the other servants, which
is always a hopeful sign, and a conscience that&rsquo;s absentee 
for about eleven months of the year, and only turns up at Lent to
annoy her husband&rsquo;s people, who are considerably Lower than
the angels, so to speak: with all these natural 
advantages&mdash;she says her particular tint of bronze is a 
natural advantage, and there can be no two opinions as to the 
advantage&mdash;of course she has to send out for her 
afflictions, like those restaurants where they haven&rsquo;t got 
a licence.&nbsp; The system has this advantage, that you can fit 
your unhappinesses in with your other engagements, whereas real 
worries have a way of arriving at meal-times, and when 
you&rsquo;re dressing, or other solemn moments.&nbsp; I knew a 
canary once that had been trying for months and years to hatch 
out a family, and everyone looked upon it as a blameless 
infatuation, like the sale of Delagoa Bay, which would be an 
annual loss to the Press agencies if it ever came to pass; and 
one day the bird really did bring it off, in the middle of family
prayers.&nbsp; I say the middle, but it was also the end: you 
can&rsquo;t go on being thankful for daily bread when you are 
wondering what on earth very new canaries expect to be fed 
on.</p>
<p>At present she&rsquo;s rather in a Balkan state of mind about 
the treatment of the Jews in Roumania.&nbsp; Personally, I think 
the Jews have estimable qualities; they&rsquo;re so kind to their
poor&mdash;and to our rich.&nbsp; I daresay in Roumania the cost 
of living beyond one&rsquo;s income isn&rsquo;t so great.&nbsp; 
Over here the trouble is that so many people who have money to 
throw about seem to have such vague ideas where to throw 
it.&nbsp; That fund, for instance, to relieve the victims of 
sudden disasters&mdash;what is a sudden disaster?&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s Marion Mulciber, who <i>would</i> think she could 
play bridge, just as she would think she could ride down a hill 
on a bicycle; on that occasion she went to a hospital, now 
she&rsquo;s gone into a Sisterhood&mdash;lost all she had, you 
know, and gave the rest to Heaven.&nbsp; Still, you can&rsquo;t 
call it a sudden calamity; <i>that</i> occurred when poor dear 
Marion was born.&nbsp; The doctors said at the time that she 
couldn&rsquo;t live more than a fortnight, and she&rsquo;s been 
trying ever since to see if she could.&nbsp; Women are so 
opinionated.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Education Question&mdash;not that I
can see that there&rsquo;s anything to worry about in that 
direction.&nbsp; To my mind, education is an absurdly over-rated 
affair.&nbsp; At least, one never took it very seriously at 
school, where everything was done to bring it prominently under 
one&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Anything that is worth knowing one 
practically teaches oneself, and the rest obtrudes itself sooner 
or later.&nbsp; The reason one&rsquo;s elders know so 
comparatively little is because they have to unlearn so much that
they acquired by way of education before we were born.&nbsp; Of 
course I&rsquo;m a believer in Nature-study; as I said to Lady 
Beauwhistle, if you want a lesson in elaborate artificiality, 
just watch the studied unconcern of a Persian cat entering a 
crowded salon, and then go and practise it for a fortnight.&nbsp;
The Beauwhistles weren&rsquo;t born in the Purple, you know, but 
they&rsquo;re getting there on the instalment system&mdash;so 
much down, and the rest when you feel like it.&nbsp; They have 
kind hearts, and they never forget birthdays.&nbsp; I forget what
he was, something in the City, where the patriotism comes from; 
and she&mdash;oh, well, her frocks are built in Paris, but she 
wears them with a strong English accent.&nbsp; So public-spirited
of her.&nbsp; I think she must have been very strictly brought 
up, she&rsquo;s so desperately anxious to do the wrong thing 
correctly.&nbsp; Not that it really matters nowadays, as I told 
her: I know some perfectly virtuous people who are received 
everywhere.</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON HOUSE-PARTIES</h2>
<p>The drawback is, one never really <i>knows</i> one&rsquo;s 
hosts and hostesses.&nbsp; One gets to know their fox-terriers 
and their chrysanthemums, and whether the story about the go-cart
can be turned loose in the drawing-room, or must be told 
privately to each member of the party, for fear of shocking 
public opinion; but one&rsquo;s host and hostess are a sort of 
human hinterland that one never has the time to explore.</p>
<p>There was a fellow I stayed with once in Warwickshire who 
farmed his own land, but was otherwise quite steady.&nbsp; Should
never have suspected him of having a soul, yet not very long 
afterwards he eloped with a lion-tamer&rsquo;s widow and set up 
as a golf-instructor somewhere on the Persian Gulf; dreadfully 
immoral, of course, because he was only an indifferent player, 
but still, it showed imagination.&nbsp; His wife was really to be
pitied, because he had been the only person in the house who 
understood how to manage the cook&rsquo;s temper, and now she has
to put &ldquo;D.V.&rdquo; on her dinner invitations.&nbsp; Still,
that&rsquo;s better than a domestic scandal; a woman who leaves 
her cook never wholly recovers her position in Society.</p>
<p>I suppose the same thing holds good with the hosts; they 
seldom have more than a superficial acquaintance with their 
guests, and so often just when they do get to know you a bit 
better, they leave off knowing you altogether.&nbsp; There was 
<i>rather</i> a breath of winter in the air when I left those 
Dorsetshire people.&nbsp; You see, they had asked me down to 
shoot, and I&rsquo;m not particularly immense at that sort of 
thing.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s such a deadly sameness about 
partridges; when you&rsquo;ve missed one, you&rsquo;ve missed the
lot&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s been my experience.&nbsp; And 
they tried to rag me in the smoking-room about not being able to 
hit a bird at five yards, a sort of bovine ragging that suggested
cows buzzing round a gadfly and thinking they were teasing 
it.&nbsp; So I got up the next morning at early dawn&mdash;I know
it was dawn, because there were lark-noises in the sky, and the 
grass looked as if it had been left out all night&mdash;and 
hunted up the most conspicuous thing in the bird line that I 
could find, and measured the distance, as nearly as it would let 
me, and shot away all I knew.&nbsp; They said afterwards that it 
was a tame bird; that&rsquo;s simply <i>silly</i>, because it was
awfully wild at the first few shots.&nbsp; Afterwards it quieted 
down a bit, and when its legs had stopped waving farewells to the
landscape I got a gardener-boy to drag it into the hall, where 
everybody must see it on their way to the breakfast-room.&nbsp; I
breakfasted upstairs myself.&nbsp; I gathered afterwards that the
meal was tinged with a very unchristian spirit.&nbsp; I suppose 
it&rsquo;s unlucky to bring peacock&rsquo;s feathers into a 
house; anyway, there was a blue-pencilly look in my 
hostess&rsquo;s eye when I took my departure.</p>
<p>Some hostesses, of course, will forgive anything, even unto 
pavonicide (is there such a word?), as long as one is 
nice-looking and sufficiently unusual to counterbalance some of 
the others; and there <i>are</i> others&mdash;the girl, for 
instance, who reads Meredith, and appears at meals with unnatural
punctuality in a frock that&rsquo;s made at home and repented at 
leisure.&nbsp; She eventually finds her way to India and gets 
married, and comes home to admire the Royal Academy, and to 
imagine that an indifferent prawn curry is for ever an effective 
substitute for all that we have been taught to believe is 
luncheon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s then that she is really dangerous; but
at her worst she is never quite so bad as the woman who fires 
<i>Exchange and Mart</i> questions at you without the least 
provocation.&nbsp; Imagine the other day, just when I was doing 
my best to understand half the things I was saying, being asked 
by one of those seekers after country home truths how many fowls 
she could keep in a run ten feet by six, or whatever it 
was!&nbsp; I told her whole crowds, as long as she kept the door 
shut, and the idea didn&rsquo;t seem to have struck her before; 
at least, she brooded over it for the rest of dinner.</p>
<p>Of course, as I say, one never really <i>knows</i> one&rsquo;s
ground, and one may make mistakes occasionally.&nbsp; But then 
one&rsquo;s mistakes sometimes turn out assets in the long-run: 
if we had never bungled away our American colonies we might never
have had the boy from the States to teach us how to wear our hair
and cut our clothes, and we must get our ideas from somewhere, I 
suppose.&nbsp; Even the Hooligan was probably invented in China 
centuries before we thought of him.&nbsp; England must wake up, 
as the Duke of Devonshire said the other day; wasn&rsquo;t 
it?&nbsp; Oh, well, it was someone else.&nbsp; Not that I ever 
indulge in despair about the Future; there always have been men 
who have gone about despairing of the Future, and when the Future
arrives it says nice, superior things about their having acted 
according to their lights.&nbsp; It is dreadful to think that 
other people&rsquo;s grandchildren may one day rise up and call 
one amiable.</p>
<p>There are moments when one sympathises with Herod.</p>
<h2>REGINALD AT THE CARLTON</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A most variable climate,&rdquo; said the Duchess; 
&ldquo;and how unfortunate that we should have had that very cold
weather at a time when coal was so dear!&nbsp; So distressing for
the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has observed that Providence is always on the 
side of the big dividends,&rdquo; remarked Reginald.</p>
<p>The Duchess ate an anchovy in a shocked manner; she was 
sufficiently old-fashioned to dislike irreverence towards 
dividends.</p>
<p>Reginald had left the selection of a feeding-ground to her 
womanly intuition, but he chose the wine himself, knowing that 
womanly intuition stops short at claret.&nbsp; A woman will 
cheerfully choose husbands for her less attractive friends, or 
take sides in a political controversy without the least knowledge
of the issues involved&mdash;but no woman ever cheerfully chose a
claret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres have always a pathetic 
interest for me,&rdquo; said Reginald: &ldquo;they remind me of 
one&rsquo;s childhood that one goes through, wondering what the 
next course is going to be like&mdash;and during the rest of the 
menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors 
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love watching the 
different ways people have of entering a restaurant?&nbsp; There 
is the woman who races in as though her whole scheme of life were
held together by a one-pin despotism which might abdicate its 
functions at any moment; it&rsquo;s really a relief to see her 
reach her chair in safety.&nbsp; Then there are the people who 
troop in with an-unpleasant-duty-to-perform air, as if they were 
angels of Death entering a plague city.&nbsp; You see that type 
of Briton very much in hotels abroad.&nbsp; And nowadays there 
are always the Johannesbourgeois, who bring a Cape-to-Cairo 
atmosphere with them&mdash;what may be called the Rand Manner, I 
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about hotels abroad,&rdquo; said the Duchess, 
&ldquo;I am preparing notes for a lecture at the Club on the 
educational effects of modern travel, dealing chiefly with the 
moral side of the question.&nbsp; I was talking to Lady 
Beauwhistle&rsquo;s aunt the other day&mdash;she&rsquo;s just 
come back from Paris, you know.&nbsp; Such a sweet 
woman&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so silly.&nbsp; In these days of the over-education
of women she&rsquo;s quite refreshing.&nbsp; They say some people
went through the siege of Paris without knowing that France and 
Germany were at war; but the Beauwhistle aunt is credited with 
having passed the whole winter in Paris under the impression that
the Humberts were a kind of bicycle . . . Isn&rsquo;t there a 
bishop or somebody who believes we shall meet all the animals we 
have known on earth in another world?&nbsp; How frightfully 
embarrassing to meet a whole shoal of whitebait you had last 
known at Prince&rsquo;s!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure in my nervousness I
should talk of nothing but lemons.&nbsp; Still, I daresay they 
would be quite as offended if one hadn&rsquo;t eaten them.&nbsp; 
I know if I were served up at a cannibal feast I should be 
dreadfully annoyed if anyone found fault with me for not being 
tender enough, or having been kept too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea about the lecture,&rdquo; resumed the Duchess 
hurriedly, &ldquo;is to inquire whether promiscuous Continental 
travel doesn&rsquo;t tend to weaken the moral fibre of the social
conscience.&nbsp; There are people one knows, quite nice people 
when they are in England, who are so <i>different</i> when they 
are anywhere the other side of the Channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people with what I call Tauchnitz morals,&rdquo; 
observed Reginald.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the whole, I think they get 
the best of two very desirable worlds.&nbsp; And, after all, they
charge so much for excess luggage on some of those foreign lines 
that it&rsquo;s really an economy to leave one&rsquo;s reputation
behind one occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scandal, my dear Reginald, is as much to be avoided 
at Monaco or any of those places as at Exeter, let us 
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scandal, my dear Irene&mdash;I may call you Irene, 
mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you have known me long enough 
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you longer than your god-parents had 
when they took the liberty of calling you that name.&nbsp; 
Scandal is merely the compassionate allowance which the gay make 
to the humdrum.&nbsp; Think how many blameless lives are 
brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people.&nbsp; 
Tell me, who is the woman with the old lace at the table on our 
left?&nbsp; Oh, <i>that</i> doesn&rsquo;t matter; it&rsquo;s 
quite the thing nowadays to stare at people as if they were 
yearlings at Tattersall&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Spelvexit?&nbsp; Quite a charming woman; separated
from her husband&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incompatibility of income?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing of that sort.&nbsp; By miles of frozen 
ocean, I was going to say.&nbsp; He explores ice-floes and 
studies the movements of herrings, and has written a most 
interesting book on the home-life of the Esquimaux; but naturally
he has very little home-life of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A husband who comes home with the Gulf Stream 
<i>would</i> be rather a tied-up asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife is exceedingly sensible about it.&nbsp; She 
collects postage-stamps.&nbsp; Such a resource.&nbsp; Those 
people with her are the Whimples, very old acquaintances of mine;
they&rsquo;re always having trouble, poor things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is not one of those fancies you can take up and
drop at any moment; it&rsquo;s like a grouse-moor or the 
opium-habit&mdash;once you start it you&rsquo;ve got to keep it 
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their eldest son was such a disappointment to them; 
they wanted him to be a linguist, and spent no end of money on 
having him taught to speak&mdash;oh, dozens of 
languages!&mdash;and then he became a Trappist monk.&nbsp; And 
the youngest, who was intended for the American marriage market, 
has developed political tendencies, and writes pamphlets about 
the housing of the poor.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s a most 
important question, and I devote a good deal of time to it myself
in the mornings; but, as Laura Whimple says, it&rsquo;s as well 
to have an establishment of one&rsquo;s own before agitating 
about other people&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She feels it very keenly, but 
she always maintains a cheerful appetite, which I think is so 
unselfish of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are different ways of taking 
disappointment.&nbsp; There was a girl I knew who nursed a 
wealthy uncle through a long illness, borne by her with Christian
fortitude, and then he died and left his money to a swine-fever 
hospital.&nbsp; She found she&rsquo;d about cleared stock in 
fortitude by that time, and now she gives drawing-room 
recitations.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I call being 
vindictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is full of its disappointments,&rdquo; observed 
the Duchess, &ldquo;and I suppose the art of being happy is to 
disguise them as illusions.&nbsp; But that, my dear Reginald, 
becomes more difficult as one grows older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more generally practised than you 
imagine.&nbsp; The young have aspirations that never come to 
pass, the old have reminiscences of what never happened.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s only the middle-aged who are really conscious of their
limitations&mdash;that is why one should be so patient with 
them.&nbsp; But one never is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;the 
disillusions of life may depend on our way of assessing it.&nbsp;
In the minds of those who come after us we may be remembered for 
qualities and successes which we quite left out of the 
reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always safe to depend on the 
commemorative tendencies of those who come after us.&nbsp; There 
may have been disillusionments in the lives of the medi&aelig;val
saints, but they would scarcely have been better pleased if they 
could have foreseen that their names would be associated nowadays
chiefly with racehorses and the cheaper clarets.&nbsp; And now, 
if you can tear yourself away from the salted almonds, 
we&rsquo;ll go and have coffee under the palms that are so 
necessary for our discomfort.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON BESETTING SINS: THE WOMAN WHO TOLD THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>There was once (said Reginald) a woman who told the 
truth.&nbsp; Not all at once, of course, but the habit grew upon 
her gradually, like lichen on an apparently healthy tree.&nbsp; 
She had no children&mdash;otherwise it might have been 
different.&nbsp; It began with little things, for no particular 
reason except that her life was a rather empty one, and it is so 
easy to slip into the habit of telling the truth in little 
matters.&nbsp; And then it became difficult to draw the line at 
more important things, until at last she took to telling the 
truth about her age; she said she was forty-two and five 
months&mdash;by that time, you see, she was veracious even to 
months.&nbsp; It may have been pleasing to the angels, but her 
elder sister was not gratified.&nbsp; On the Woman&rsquo;s 
birthday, instead of the opera-tickets which she had hoped for, 
her sister gave her a view of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives,
which is not quite the same thing.&nbsp; The revenge of an elder 
sister may be long in coming, but, like a South-Eastern express, 
it arrives in its own good time.</p>
<p>The friends of the Woman tried to dissuade her from 
over-indulgence in the practice, but she said she was wedded to 
the truth; whereupon it was remarked that it was scarcely logical
to be so much together in public.&nbsp; (No really provident 
woman lunches regularly with her husband if she wishes to burst 
upon him as a revelation at dinner.&nbsp; He must have time to 
forget; an afternoon is not enough.)&nbsp; And after a while her 
friends began to thin out in patches.&nbsp; Her passion for the 
truth was not compatible with a large visiting-list.&nbsp; For 
instance, she told Miriam Klopstock <i>exactly</i> how she looked
at the Ilexes&rsquo; ball.&nbsp; Certainly Miriam had asked for 
her candid opinion, but the Woman prayed in church every Sunday 
for peace in our time, and it was not consistent.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, everyone agreed, that she had no family; 
with a child or two in the house, there is an unconscious check 
upon too free an indulgence in the truth.&nbsp; Children are 
given us to discourage our better emotions.&nbsp; That is why the
stage, with all its efforts, can never be as artificial as life; 
even in an Ibsen drama one must reveal to the audience things 
that one would suppress before the children or servants.</p>
<p>Fate may have ordained the truth-telling from the commencement
and should justly bear some of the blame; but in having no 
children the Woman was guilty, at least, of contributory 
negligence.</p>
<p>Little by little she felt she was becoming a slave to what had
once been merely an idle propensity; and one day she knew.&nbsp; 
Every woman tells ninety per cent. of the truth to her 
dressmaker; the other ten per cent. is the irreducible minimum of
deception beyond which no self-respecting client 
trespasses.&nbsp; Madame Draga&rsquo;s establishment was a 
meeting-ground for naked truths and over-dressed fictions, and it
was here, the Woman felt, that she might make a final effort to 
recall the artless mendacity of past days.&nbsp; Madame herself 
was in an inspiring mood, with the air of a sphinx who knew all 
things and preferred to forget most of them.&nbsp; As a War 
Minister she might have been celebrated, but she was content to 
be merely rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I take it in here, and&mdash;Miss Howard, one 
moment, if you please&mdash;and there, and round like 
this&mdash;so&mdash;I really think you will find it quite 
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Woman hesitated; it seemed to require such a small effort 
to simply acquiesce in Madame&rsquo;s views.&nbsp; But habit had 
become too strong.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she 
faltered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the least little bit in the 
world too&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>And by that least little bit she measured the deeps and 
eternities of her thraldom to fact.&nbsp; Madame was not best 
pleased at being contradicted on a professional matter, and when 
Madame lost her temper you usually found it afterwards in the 
bill.</p>
<p>And at last the dreadful thing came, as the Woman had foreseen
all along that it must; it was one of those paltry little truths 
with which she harried her waking hours.&nbsp; On a raw Wednesday
morning, in a few ill-chosen words, she told the cook that she 
drank.&nbsp; She remembered the scene afterwards as vividly as 
though it had been painted in her mind by Abbey.&nbsp; The cook 
was a good cook, as cooks go; and as cooks go she went.</p>
<p>Miriam Klopstock came to lunch the next day.&nbsp; Women and 
elephants never forget an injury.</p>
<h2>REGINALD&rsquo;S DRAMA</h2>
<p>Reginald closed his eyes with the elaborate weariness of one 
who has rather nice eyelashes and thinks it useless to conceal 
the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall write
a really great drama.&nbsp; No one will understand the drift of 
it, but everyone will go back to their homes with a vague feeling
of dissatisfaction with their lives and surroundings.&nbsp; Then 
they will put up new wall-papers and forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about those that have oak panelling all over 
the house?&rdquo; said the Other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can always put down new stair-carpets,&rdquo; 
pursued Reginald, &ldquo;and, anyhow, I&rsquo;m not responsible 
for the audience having a happy ending.&nbsp; The play would be 
quite sufficient strain on one&rsquo;s energies.&nbsp; I should 
get a bishop to say it was immoral and beautiful&mdash;no 
dramatist has thought of that before, and everyone would come to 
condemn the bishop, and they would stay on out of sheer 
nervousness.&nbsp; After all, it requires a great deal of moral 
courage to leave in a marked manner in the middle of the second 
act, when your carriage isn&rsquo;t ordered till twelve.&nbsp; 
And it would commence with wolves worrying something on a lonely 
waste&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t see them, of course; but you would
hear them snarling and scrunching, and I should arrange to have a
wolfy fragrance suggested across the footlights.&nbsp; It would 
look so well on the programmes, &lsquo;Wolves in the first act, 
by Jamrach.&rsquo;&nbsp; And old Lady Whortleberry, who never 
misses a first night, would scream.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always been
nervous since she lost her first husband.&nbsp; He died quite 
abruptly while watching a county cricket match; two and a half 
inches of rain had fallen for seven runs, and it was supposed 
that the excitement killed him.&nbsp; Anyhow, it gave her quite a
shock; it was the first husband she&rsquo;d lost, you know, and 
now she always screams if anything thrilling happens too soon 
after dinner.&nbsp; And after the audience had heard the 
Whortleberry scream the thing would be fairly 
launched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the plot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;would be one of 
those little everyday tragedies that one sees going on all round 
one.&nbsp; In my mind&rsquo;s eye there is the case of the 
Mudge-Jervises, which in an unpretentious way has quite an Enoch 
Arden intensity underlying it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d only been 
married some eighteen months or so, and circumstances had 
prevented their seeing much of each other.&nbsp; With him there 
was always a foursome or something that had to be played and 
replayed in different parts of the country, and she went in for 
slumming quite as seriously as if it was a sport.&nbsp; With her,
I suppose, it was.&nbsp; She belonged to the Guild of the Poor 
Dear Souls, and they hold the record for having nearly reformed a
washerwoman.&nbsp; No one has ever really reformed a washerwoman,
and that is why the competition is so keen.&nbsp; You can rescue 
charwomen by fifties with a little tea and personal magnetism, 
but with washerwomen it&rsquo;s different; wages are too 
high.&nbsp; This particular laundress, who came from Bermondsey 
or some such place, was really rather a hopeful venture, and they
thought at last that she might be safely put in the window as a 
specimen of successful work.&nbsp; So they had her paraded at a 
drawing-room &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; at Agatha Camelford&rsquo;s; 
it was sheer bad luck that some liqueur chocolates had been 
turned loose by mistake among the refreshments&mdash;really 
liqueur chocolates, with very little chocolate.&nbsp; And of 
course the old soul found them out, and cornered the entire 
stock.&nbsp; It was like finding a whelk-stall in a desert, as 
she afterwards partially expressed herself.&nbsp; When the 
liqueurs began to take effect, she started to give them 
imitations of farmyard animals as they know them in 
Bermondsey.&nbsp; She began with a dancing bear, and you know 
Agatha doesn&rsquo;t approve of dancing, except at Buckingham 
Palace under proper supervision.&nbsp; And then she got up on the
piano and gave them an organ monkey; I gather she went in for 
realism rather than a Maeterlinckian treatment of the 
subject.&nbsp; Finally, she fell into the piano and said she was 
a parrot in a cage, and for an impromptu performance I believe 
she was very word-perfect; no one had heard anything like it, 
except Baroness Boobelstein who has attended sittings of the 
Austrian Reichsrath.&nbsp; Agatha is trying the Rest-cure at 
Buxton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Mudge-Jervises.&nbsp; Well, they were getting 
along quite happily, and their married life was one continuous 
exchange of picture-postcards; and then one day they were thrown 
together on some neutral ground where foursomes and washerwomen 
overlapped, and discovered that they were hopelessly divided on 
the Fiscal Question.&nbsp; They have thought it best to separate,
and she is to have the custody of the Persian kittens for nine 
months in the year&mdash;they go back to him for the winter, when
she is abroad.&nbsp; There you have the material for a tragedy 
drawn straight from life&mdash;and the piece could be called 
&lsquo;The Price They Paid for Empire.&rsquo;&nbsp; And of course
one would have to work in studies of the struggle of hereditary 
tendency against environment and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; 
The woman&rsquo;s father could have been an Envoy to some of the 
smaller German Courts; that&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;d get her 
passion for visiting the poor, in spite of the most careful 
upbringing.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est le premier pa qui compte</i>, as
the cuckoo said when it swallowed its foster-parent.&nbsp; That, 
I think, is quite clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the wolves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the wolves would be a sort of elusive undercurrent 
in the background that would never be satisfactorily 
explained.&nbsp; After all, life teems with things that have no 
earthly reason.&nbsp; And whenever the characters could think of 
nothing brilliant to say about marriage or the War Office, they 
could open a window and listen to the howling of the 
wolves.&nbsp; But that would be very seldom.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>REGINALD ON TARIFFS</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to discuss the Fiscal Question (said 
Reginald); I wish to be original.&nbsp; At the same time, I think
one suffers more than one realises from the system of free 
imports.&nbsp; I should like, for instance, a really prohibitive 
duty put upon the partner who declares on a weak red suit and 
hopes for the best.&nbsp; Even a free outlet for compressed 
verbiage doesn&rsquo;t balance matters.&nbsp; And I think there 
should be a sort of bounty-fed export (is that the right 
expression?) of the people who impress on you that you ought to 
take life seriously.&nbsp; There are only two classes that really
can&rsquo;t help taking life seriously&mdash;schoolgirls of 
thirteen and Hohenzollerns; they might be exempt.&nbsp; Albanians
come under another heading; they take life whenever they get the 
opportunity.&nbsp; The one Albanian that I was ever on speaking 
terms with was rather a decadent example.&nbsp; He was a 
Christian and a grocer, and I don&rsquo;t fancy he had ever 
killed anybody.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like to question him on the 
subject&mdash;that showed my delicacy.&nbsp; Mrs. Nicorax says I 
have no delicacy; she hasn&rsquo;t forgiven me about the 
mice.&nbsp; You see, when I was staying down there, a mouse used 
to cake-walk about my room half the night, and none of their 
silly patent traps seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence,
so I determined to appeal to the better side of it&mdash;which 
with mice is the inside.&nbsp; So I called it Percy, and put 
little delicacies down near its hole every night, and that kept 
it quiet while I read Max Nordau&rsquo;s <i>Degeneration</i> and 
other reproving literature, and went to sleep.&nbsp; And now she 
says there is a whole colony of mice in that room.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t where the indelicacy comes in.&nbsp; She went
out riding with me, which was entirely her own suggestion, and as
we were coming home through some meadows she made a quite 
unnecessary attempt to see if her pony would jump a rather messy 
sort of brook that was there.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It 
went with her as far as the water&rsquo;s edge, and from that 
point Mrs. Nicorax went on alone.&nbsp; Of course I had to fish 
her out from the bank, and my riding-breeches are not cut with a 
view to salmon-fishing&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather an art even to 
ride in them.&nbsp; Her habit-skirt was one of those open 
questions that need not be adhered to in emergencies, and on this
occasion it remained behind in some water-weeds.&nbsp; She wanted
me to fish about for that too, but I felt I had done enough 
Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter business for an October afternoon, and I
was beginning to want my tea.&nbsp; So I bundled her up on to her
pony, and gave her a lead towards home as fast as I cared to 
go.&nbsp; What with the wet and the unusual responsibility, her 
abridged costume did not stand the pace particularly well, and 
she got quite querulous when I shouted back that I had no pins 
with me&mdash;and no string.&nbsp; Some women expect so much from
a fellow.&nbsp; When we got into the drive she wanted to go up 
the back way to the stables, but the ponies <i>know</i> they 
always get sugar at the front door, and I never attempt to hold a
pulling pony; as for Mrs. Nicorax, it took her all she knew to 
keep a firm hand on her seceding garments, which, as her maid 
remarked afterwards, were more <i>tout</i> than 
<i>ensemble</i>.&nbsp; Of course nearly the whole house-party 
were out on the lawn watching the sunset&mdash;the only day this 
month that it&rsquo;s occurred to the sun to show itself, as Mrs.
Nic. viciously observed&mdash;and I shall never forget the 
expression on her husband&rsquo;s face as we pulled up.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;My darling, this is too much!&rdquo; was his first spoken 
comment; taking into consideration the state of her toilet, it 
was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard him say, and I went
into the library to be alone and scream.&nbsp; Mrs. Nicorax says 
I have no delicacy.</p>
<p>Talking about tariffs, the lift-boy, who reads extensively 
between the landings, says it won&rsquo;t do to tax raw 
commodities.&nbsp; What, exactly, is a raw commodity?&nbsp; Mrs. 
Van Challaby says men are raw commodities till you marry them; 
after they&rsquo;ve struck Mrs. Van C., I can fancy they pretty 
soon become a finished article.&nbsp; Certainly she&rsquo;s had a
good deal of experience to support her opinion.&nbsp; She lost 
one husband in a railway accident, and mislaid another in the 
Divorce Court, and the current one has just got himself squeezed 
in a Beef Trust.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was he doing in a Beef Trust, 
anyway?&rdquo; she asked tearfully, and I suggested that perhaps 
he had an unhappy home.&nbsp; I only said it for the sake of 
making conversation; which it did.&nbsp; Mrs. Van Challaby said 
things about me which in her calmer moments she would have 
hesitated to spell.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity people can&rsquo;t 
discuss fiscal matters without getting wild.&nbsp; However, she 
wrote next day to ask if I could get her a Yorkshire terrier of 
the size and shade that&rsquo;s being worn now, and that&rsquo;s 
as near as a woman can be expected to get to owning herself in 
the wrong.&nbsp; And she will tie a salmon-pink bow to its 
collar, and call it &ldquo;Reggie,&rdquo; and take it with her 
everywhere&mdash;like poor Miriam Klopstock, who <i>would</i> 
take her Chow with her to the bathroom, and while she was bathing
it was playing at she-bears with her garments.&nbsp; Miriam is 
always late for breakfast, and she wasn&rsquo;t really missed 
till the middle of lunch.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not going any further into the Fiscal 
Question.&nbsp; Only I should like to be protected from the 
partner with a weak red tendency.</p>
<h2>REGINALD&rsquo;S CHRISTMAS REVEL</h2>
<p>They say (said Reginald) that there&rsquo;s nothing sadder 
than victory except defeat.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever stayed 
with dull people during what is alleged to be the festive season,
you can probably revise that saying.&nbsp; I shall never forget 
putting in a Christmas at the Babwolds&rsquo;.&nbsp; Mrs. Babwold
is some relation of my father&rsquo;s&mdash;a sort of 
to-be-left-till-called-for cousin&mdash;and that was considered 
sufficient reason for my having to accept her invitation at about
the sixth time of asking; though why the sins of the father 
should be visited by the children&mdash;you won&rsquo;t find any 
notepaper in that drawer; that&rsquo;s where I keep old menus and
first-night programmes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Babwold wears a rather solemn personality, and has never 
been known to smile, even when saying disagreeable things to her 
friends or making out the Stores list.&nbsp; She takes her 
pleasures sadly.&nbsp; A state elephant at a Durbar gives one a 
very similar impression.&nbsp; Her husband gardens in all 
weathers.&nbsp; When a man goes out in the pouring rain to brush 
caterpillars off rose-trees, I generally imagine his life indoors
leaves something to be desired; anyway, it must be very 
unsettling for the caterpillars.</p>
<p>Of course there were other people there.&nbsp; There was a 
Major Somebody who had shot things in Lapland, or somewhere of 
that sort; I forget what they were, but it wasn&rsquo;t for want 
of reminding.&nbsp; We had them cold with every meal almost, and 
he was continually giving us details of what they measured from 
tip to tip, as though he thought we were going to make them warm 
under-things for the winter.&nbsp; I used to listen to him with a
rapt attention that I thought rather suited me, and then one day 
I quite modestly gave the dimensions of an okapi I had shot in 
the Lincolnshire fens.&nbsp; The Major turned a beautiful Tyrian 
scarlet (I remember thinking at the time that I should like my 
bathroom hung in that colour), and I think that at that moment he
almost found it in his heart to dislike me.&nbsp; Mrs. Babwold 
put on a first-aid-to-the-injured expression, and asked him why 
he didn&rsquo;t publish a book of his sporting reminiscences; it 
would be <i>so</i> interesting.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t remember 
till afterwards that he had given her two fat volumes on the 
subject, with his portrait and autograph as a frontispiece and an
appendix on the habits of the Arctic mussel.</p>
<p>It was in the evening that we cast aside the cares and 
distractions of the day and really lived.&nbsp; Cards were 
thought to be too frivolous and empty a way of passing the time, 
so most of them played what they called a book game.&nbsp; You 
went out into the hall&mdash;to get an inspiration, I 
suppose&mdash;then you came in again with a muffler tied round 
your neck and looked silly, and the others were supposed to guess
that you were &ldquo;Wee MacGreegor.&rdquo;&nbsp; I held out 
against the inanity as long as I decently could, but at last, in 
a lapse of good-nature, I consented to masquerade as a book, only
I warned them that it would take some time to carry out.&nbsp; 
They waited for the best part of forty minutes, while I went and 
played wineglass skittles with the page-boy in the pantry; you 
play it with a champagne cork, you know, and the one who knocks 
down the most glasses without breaking them wins.&nbsp; I won, 
with four unbroken out of seven; I think William suffered from 
over-anxiousness.&nbsp; They were rather mad in the drawing-room 
at my not having come back, and they weren&rsquo;t a bit pacified
when I told them afterwards that I was &ldquo;At the end of the 
passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did like Kipling,&rdquo; was Mrs. 
Babwold&rsquo;s comment, when the situation dawned upon 
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see anything clever in 
<i>Earthworms out of Tuscany</i>&mdash;or is that by 
Darwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course these games are very educational, but, personally, I
prefer bridge.</p>
<p>On Christmas evening we were supposed to be specially festive 
in the Old English fashion.&nbsp; The hall was horribly draughty,
but it seemed to be the proper place to revel in, and it was 
decorated with Japanese fans and Chinese lanterns, which gave it 
a very Old English effect.&nbsp; A young lady with a confidential
voice favoured us with a long recitation about a little girl who 
died or did something equally hackneyed, and then the Major gave 
us a graphic account of a struggle he had with a wounded 
bear.&nbsp; I privately wished that the bears would win sometimes
on these occasions; at least they wouldn&rsquo;t go vapouring 
about it afterwards.&nbsp; Before we had time to recover our 
spirits, we were indulged with some thought-reading by a young 
man whom one knew instinctively had a good mother and an 
indifferent tailor&mdash;the sort of young man who talks 
unflaggingly through the thickest soup, and smooths his hair 
dubiously as though he thought it might hit back.&nbsp; The 
thought-reading was rather a success; he announced that the 
hostess was thinking about poetry, and she admitted that her mind
was dwelling on one of Austin&rsquo;s odes.&nbsp; Which was near 
enough.&nbsp; I fancy she had been really wondering whether a 
scrag-end of mutton and some cold plum-pudding would do for the 
kitchen dinner next day.&nbsp; As a crowning dissipation, they 
all sat down to play progressive halma, with milk-chocolate for 
prizes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been carefully brought up, and I 
don&rsquo;t like to play games of skill for milk-chocolate, so I 
invented a headache and retired from the scene.&nbsp; I had been 
preceded a few minutes earlier by Miss Langshan-Smith, a rather 
formidable lady, who always got up at some uncomfortable hour in 
the morning, and gave you the impression that she had been in 
communication with most of the European Governments before 
breakfast.&nbsp; There was a paper pinned on her door with a 
signed request that she might be called particularly early on the
morrow.&nbsp; Such an opportunity does not come twice in a 
lifetime.&nbsp; I covered up everything except the signature with
another notice, to the effect that before these words should meet
the eye she would have ended a misspent life, was sorry for the 
trouble she was giving, and would like a military funeral.&nbsp; 
A few minutes later I violently exploded an air-filled paper bag 
on the landing, and gave a stage moan that could have been heard 
in the cellars.&nbsp; Then I pursued my original intention and 
went to bed.&nbsp; The noise those people made in forcing open 
the good lady&rsquo;s door was positively indecorous; she 
resisted gallantly, but I believe they searched her for bullets 
for about a quarter of an hour, as if she had been an historic 
battlefield.</p>
<p>I hate travelling on Boxing Day, but one must occasionally do 
things that one dislikes.</p>
<h2>REGINALD&rsquo;S RUBAIYAT</h2>
<p>The other day (confided Reginald), when I was killing time in 
the bathroom and making bad resolutions for the New Year, it 
occurred to me that I would like to be a poet.&nbsp; The chief 
qualification, I understand, is that you must be born.&nbsp; 
Well, I hunted up my birth certificate, and found that I was all 
right on that score, and then I got to work on a Hymn to the New 
Year, which struck me as having possibilities.&nbsp; It suggested
extremely unusual things to absolutely unlikely people, which I 
believe is the art of first-class catering in any 
department.&nbsp; Quite the best verse in it went something like 
this&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have you heard the groan of a gravelled 
grouse,<br />
Or the snarl of a snaffled snail<br />
(Husband or mother, like me, or spouse),<br />
Have you lain a-creep in the darkened house<br />
Where the wounded wombats wail?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was quite improbable that anyone had, you know, and 
that&rsquo;s where it stimulated the imagination and took people 
out of their narrow, humdrum selves.&nbsp; No one has ever called
me narrow or humdrum, but even I felt worked up now and then at 
the thought of that house with the stricken wombats in it.&nbsp; 
It simply wasn&rsquo;t nice.&nbsp; But the editors were unanimous
in leaving it alone; they said the thing had been done before and
done worse, and that the market for that sort of work was 
extremely limited.</p>
<p>It was just on the top of that discouragement that the Duchess
wanted me to write something in her album&mdash;something 
Persian, you know, and just a little bit decadent&mdash;and I 
thought a quatrain on an unwholesome egg would meet the 
requirements of the case.&nbsp; So I started in with&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cackle, cackle, little hen,<br />
How I wonder if and when<br />
Once you laid the egg that I<br />
Met, alas! too late.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Duchess objected to the Amen, which I thought gave an air 
of forgiveness and <i>chose jug&eacute;e</i> to the whole thing; 
also she said it wasn&rsquo;t Persian enough, as though I were 
trying to sell her a kitten whose mother had married for love 
rather than pedigree.&nbsp; So I recast it entirely, and the new 
version read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The hen that laid thee moons ago, who 
knows<br />
In what Dead Yesterday her shades repose;<br />
To some election turn thy waning span<br />
And rain thy rottenness on fiscal foes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought there was enough suggestion of decay in that to 
satisfy a jackal, and to me there was something infinitely 
pathetic and appealing in the idea of the egg having a sort of 
St. Luke&rsquo;s summer of commercial usefulness.&nbsp; But the 
Duchess begged me to leave out any political allusions; 
she&rsquo;s the president of a Women&rsquo;s Something or other, 
and she said it might be taken as an endorsement of deplorable 
methods.&nbsp; I never can remember which Party Irene discourages
with her support, but I shan&rsquo;t forget an occasion when I 
was staying at her place and she gave me a pamphlet to leave at 
the house of a doubtful voter, and some grapes and things for a 
woman who was suffering from a chill on the top of a patent 
medicine.&nbsp; I thought it much cleverer to give the grapes to 
the former and the political literature to the sick woman, and 
the Duchess was quite absurdly annoyed about it afterwards.&nbsp;
It seems the leaflet was addressed &ldquo;To those about to 
wobble&rdquo;&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t responsible for the silly 
title of the thing&mdash;and the woman never recovered; anyway, 
the voter was completely won over by the grapes and jellies, and 
I think that should have balanced matters.&nbsp; The Duchess 
called it bribery, and said it might have compromised the 
candidate she was supporting; he was expected to subscribe to 
church funds and chapel funds, and football and cricket clubs and
regattas, and bazaars and beanfeasts and bellringers, and poultry
shows and ploughing matches, and reading-rooms and choir outings,
and shooting trophies and testimonials, and anything of that 
sort; but bribery would not have been tolerated.</p>
<p>I fancy I have perhaps more talent for electioneering than for
poetry, and I was really getting extended over this quatrain 
business.&nbsp; The egg began to be unmanageable, and the Duchess
suggested something with a French literary ring about it.&nbsp; I
hunted back in my mind for the most familiar French classic that 
I could take liberties with, and after a little exercise of 
memory I turned out the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hast thou the pen that once the gardener 
had?<br />
I have it not; and know, these pears are bad.<br />
Oh, larger than the horses of the Prince<br />
Are those the general drives in Kaikobad.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even that didn&rsquo;t altogether satisfy Irene; I fancy the 
geography of it puzzled her.&nbsp; She probably thought Kaikobad 
was an unfashionable German spa, where you&rsquo;d meet 
matrimonial bargain-hunters and emergency Servian kings.&nbsp; My
temper was beginning to slip its moorings by that time.&nbsp; I 
look rather nice when I lose my temper.&nbsp; (I hoped you would 
say I lose it very often.&nbsp; I mustn&rsquo;t monopolise the 
conversation.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you want something really Persian and 
passionate, with red wine and bulbuls in it,&rdquo; I went on to 
suggest; but she grabbed the book away from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds.&nbsp; Nothing with red wine or passion 
in it.&nbsp; Dear Agatha gave me the album, and she would be 
mortified to the quick&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>I said I didn&rsquo;t believe Agatha had a quick, and we got 
quite heated in arguing the matter.&nbsp; Finally, the Duchess 
declared I shouldn&rsquo;t write anything nasty in her book, and 
I said I wouldn&rsquo;t write anything in her nasty book, so 
there wasn&rsquo;t a very wide point of difference between 
us.&nbsp; For the rest of the afternoon I pretended to be 
sulking, but I was really working back to that quatrain, like a 
fox-terrier that&rsquo;s buried a deferred lunch in a private 
flower-bed.&nbsp; When I got an opportunity I hunted up 
Agatha&rsquo;s autograph, which had the front page all to itself,
and, copying her prim handwriting as well as I could, I inserted 
above it the following Thibetan fragment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With Thee, oh, my Beloved, to do a 
d&acirc;k<br />
(a d&acirc;k I believe is a sort of uncomfortable 
post-journey)<br />
On the pack-saddle of a grunting yak,<br />
With never room for chilling chaperone,<br />
&rsquo;Twere better than a Panhard in the Park.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Agatha would get on to a yak in company with a lover even
in the comparative seclusion of Thibet is unthinkable.&nbsp; I 
very much doubt if she&rsquo;d do it with her own husband in the 
privacy of the Simplon tunnel.&nbsp; But poetry, as I&rsquo;ve 
remarked before, should always stimulate the imagination.</p>
<p>By the way, when you asked me the other day to dine with you 
on the 14th, I said I was dining with the Duchess.&nbsp; Well, 
I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dining with you.</p>
<h2>THE INNOCENCE OF REGINALD</h2>
<p>Reginald slid a carnation of the newest shade into the 
buttonhole of his latest lounge coat, and surveyed the result 
with approval.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am just in the mood,&rdquo; he 
observed, &ldquo;to have my portrait painted by someone with an 
unmistakable future.&nbsp; So comforting to go down to posterity 
as &lsquo;Youth with a Pink Carnation&rsquo; in 
catalogue&mdash;company with &lsquo;Child with Bunch of 
Primroses,&rsquo; and all that crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said the Other, &ldquo;should suggest 
innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But never act on the suggestion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
believe the two ever really go together.&nbsp; People talk 
vaguely about the innocence of a little child, but they take 
mighty good care not to let it out of their sight for twenty 
minutes.&nbsp; The watched pot never boils over.&nbsp; I knew a 
boy once who really was innocent; his parents were in Society, 
but they never gave him a moment&rsquo;s anxiety from his 
infancy.&nbsp; He believed in company prospectuses, and in the 
purity of elections, and in women marrying for love, and even in 
a system for winning at roulette.&nbsp; He never quite lost his 
faith in it, but he dropped more money than his employers could 
afford to lose.&nbsp; When last I heard of him, he was believing 
in his innocence; the jury weren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All the same, I 
really am innocent just now of something everyone accuses me of 
having done, and so far as I can see, their accusations will 
remain unfounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather an unexpected attitude for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love people who do unexpected things.&nbsp; 
Didn&rsquo;t you always adore the man who slew a lion in a pit on
a snowy day?&nbsp; But about this unfortunate innocence.&nbsp; 
Well, quite long ago, when I&rsquo;d been quarrelling with more 
people than usual, you among the number&mdash;it must have been 
in November, I never quarrel with you too near Christmas&mdash;I 
had an idea that I&rsquo;d like to write a book.&nbsp; It was to 
be a book of personal reminiscences, and was to leave out 
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reginald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what the Duchess said when I mentioned it to 
her.&nbsp; I was provoking and said nothing, and the next thing, 
of course, was that everyone heard that I&rsquo;d written the 
book and got it in the press.&nbsp; After that, I might have been
a gold-fish in a glass bowl for all the privacy I got.&nbsp; 
People attacked me about it in the most unexpected places, and 
implored or commanded me to leave out things that I&rsquo;d 
forgotten had ever happened.&nbsp; I sat behind Miriam Klopstock 
one night in the dress circle at His Majesty&rsquo;s, and she 
began at once about the incident of the Chow dog in the bathroom,
which she insisted must be struck out.&nbsp; We had to argue it 
in a disjointed fashion, because some of the people wanted to 
listen to the play, and Miriam takes nines in voices.&nbsp; They 
had to stop her playing in the &lsquo;Macaws&rsquo; Hockey Club 
because you could hear what she thought when her shins got mixed 
up in a scrimmage for half a mile on a still day.&nbsp; They are 
called the Macaws because of their blue-and-yellow costumes, but 
I understand there was nothing yellow about Miriam&rsquo;s 
language.&nbsp; I agreed to make one alteration, as I pretended I
had got it a Spitz instead of a Chow, but beyond that I was 
firm.&nbsp; She megaphoned back two minutes later, &lsquo;You 
promised you would never mention it; don&rsquo;t you ever keep a 
promise?&rsquo;&nbsp; When people had stopped glaring in our 
direction, I replied that I&rsquo;d as soon think of keeping 
white mice.&nbsp; I saw her tearing little bits out of her 
programme for a minute or two, and then she leaned back and 
snorted, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not the boy I took you for,&rsquo; 
as though she were an eagle arriving at Olympus with the wrong 
Ganymede.&nbsp; That was her last audible remark, but she went on
tearing up her programme and scattering the pieces around her, 
till one of her neighbours asked with immense dignity whether she
should send for a wastepaper basket.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t stay 
for the last act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is Mrs.&mdash;oh, I never can remember her 
name; she lives in a street that the cabmen have never heard of, 
and is at home on Wednesdays.&nbsp; She frightened me horribly 
once at a private view by saying mysteriously, &lsquo;I 
oughtn&rsquo;t to be here, you know; this is one of my 
days.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thought she meant that she was subject to 
periodical outbreaks and was expecting an attack at any 
moment.&nbsp; So embarrassing if she had suddenly taken it into 
her head that she was Cesar Borgia or St. Elizabeth of 
Hungary.&nbsp; That sort of thing would make one unpleasantly 
conspicuous even at a private view.&nbsp; However, she merely 
meant to say that it was Wednesday, which at the moment was 
incontrovertible.&nbsp; Well, she&rsquo;s on quite a different 
tack to the Klopstock.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t visit anywhere 
very extensively, and, of course, she&rsquo;s awfully keen for me
to drag in an incident that occurred at one of the Beauwhistle 
garden-parties, when she says she accidentally hit the shins of a
Serene Somebody or other with a croquet mallet and that he swore 
at her in German.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he went on 
discoursing on the Gordon-Bennett affair in French.&nbsp; (I 
never can remember if it&rsquo;s a new submarine or a 
divorce.&nbsp; Of course, how stupid of me!)&nbsp; To be 
disagreeably exact, I fancy she missed him by about two 
inches&mdash;over-anxiousness, probably&mdash;but she likes to 
think she hit him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve felt that way with a 
partridge which I always imagine keeps on flying strong, out of 
false pride, till it&rsquo;s the other side of the hedge.&nbsp; 
She said she could tell me everything she was wearing on the 
occasion.&nbsp; I said I didn&rsquo;t want my book to read like a
laundry list, but she explained that she didn&rsquo;t mean those 
sort of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the Chilworth boy, who can be 
charming as long as he&rsquo;s content to be stupid and wear what
he&rsquo;s told to; but he gets the idea now and then that 
he&rsquo;d like to be epigrammatic, and the result is like 
watching a rook trying to build a nest in a gale.&nbsp; Since he 
got wind of the book, he&rsquo;s been persecuting me to work in 
something of his about the Russians and the Yalu Peril, and is 
quite sulky because I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether, I think it would be rather a brilliant 
inspiration if you were to suggest a fortnight in 
Paris.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
